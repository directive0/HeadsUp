# HeadsUp!

A simple pygame interface for a heads up display (HUD) intended to work with [VuFine headsets](https://www.vufine.com/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). It is the joint effort of two people who have never met. 

- Code by [C.Barrett](http://www.directive0.com)

- Design by [S.Caem](mailto:thedigitons@gmail.com)

The basic design intent of this program is to allow users to be able to access text and image reference, to view sensors related to the environment, and to trigger and receive IFTTT webhook events all from a simple wearable computing rig. It aims to offer some functionality approaching the level of products like Google Glass or HoloLens but without any augmented reality. 

A secondary desire of the project is that it be modular and allow users with a moderate knowledge of Python to create their own tile layouts if they desire, but this aspect is not fully realized yet.
